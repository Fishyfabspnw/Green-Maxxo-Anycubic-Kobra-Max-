# Nozzle Brush Arm Configuration Instructions


This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring and using a nozzle brush arm on your 3D printer. The setup includes macros for deploying, retracting, and using the brush arm to clean the nozzle. These instructions are intended for users to implement into their builds.

Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:

Your 3D printer has a brush arm actuator installed.

A stepper driver is configured for the brush arm actuator.

You are using Klipper firmware for your 3D printer.

An endstop switch is installed for homing the actuator.

Klipper Configuration

To enable the nozzle brush arm functionality, add the following macros to your printer.cfg file.

Deploy Brush Arm

This macro deploys the nozzle brush arm to the cleaning position.

[gcode_macro DEPLOY_BRUSH_ARM]
gcode:
  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator MOVE=100 SPEED=200 STOP_ON_ENDSTOP=1
  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator SET_POSITION=0
  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator MOVE=-90 SPEED=200

Retract Brush Arm

This macro retracts the nozzle brush arm to its storage position.

[gcode_macro UNDEPLOY_BRUSH_ARM]
gcode:
  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator MOVE=90 SPEED=200 STOP_ON_ENDSTOP=1
  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator SET_POSITION=0 SYNC=0

Clean Nozzle

This macro performs a nozzle cleaning sequence using the brush arm.

[gcode_macro CLEAN_NOZZLE]
gcode:
  G91                            ; Set relative positioning
  G1 Z23 F1200                   ; Raise the Z-axis to avoid collisions
  G90                            ; Restore absolute positioning

  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator MOVE=100 SPEED=200 STOP_ON_ENDSTOP=1
  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator MOVE=-5 SPEED=100
  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator MOVE=100 SPEED=50 STOP_ON_ENDSTOP=1
  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator SET_POSITION=0
  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator MOVE=-87 SPEED=300

  G1 X65 Y75 Z24 F6000           ; Move to the starting position
  G1 X15 F6000                   ; Perform cleaning motion
  G1 X65 F6000                   ; Return to the start
  G1 X15 F6000                   ; Repeat motion
  G1 X65 F6000 E0.2              ; Wipe with slight extrusion
  G1 X15 F9000                   ; Final wipe
  G1 X75 F9000 E-0.2             ; Retract filament slightly

  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator MOVE=90 SPEED=300 STOP_ON_ENDSTOP=1
  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator SET_POSITION=0 SYNC=0
  MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=brush_actuator ENABLE=0

Usage Instructions

Deploying the Brush Arm

To deploy the brush arm, run the following command:

DEPLOY_BRUSH_ARM

Cleaning the Nozzle

To clean the nozzle using the brush arm, run:

CLEAN_NOZZLE

This macro will:

Raise the Z-axis to avoid collisions.

Deploy the brush arm.

Move the nozzle across the brush in a cleaning motion.

Retract the brush arm after cleaning.

Retracting the Brush Arm

To retract the brush arm manually, use:

UNDEPLOY_BRUSH_ARM

Integration with Print Start G-code

For automated cleaning before every print, add the following to your slicerâ€™s start G-code:

CLEAN_NOZZLE

Troubleshooting

Brush Arm Does Not Deploy Correctly:

Verify the MOVE and SPEED values in the macros.

Ensure the actuator is properly installed and the stepper driver is configured.

Nozzle Does Not Clean Effectively:

Adjust the X, Y, and Z values in the CLEAN_NOZZLE macro to better align with the brush.

Increase the number of cleaning passes if necessary.

Collisions During Cleaning:

Ensure the Z-axis raises sufficiently before deploying the brush arm.

Verify the coordinates in the macros to avoid hitting the bed or other componen
